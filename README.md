## Dependencies
* Python (version 3.6)

## Usage
To run the code, save the Python script as `main.py` and execute it from the terminal using `python main.py`.

## Known Issues
* Formatting in Part 3 WAS fixed, but by then I had past the deadline by an hour and a quarter and wasn't going to resubmit it, so I just sent it via email because I was chuffed I fixed it. :)

## Additional Notes
* Do not use this code to cheat on your assignment, if similar. Cheating only cheats yourself!
